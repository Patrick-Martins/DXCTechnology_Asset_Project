            DXC Global Data Management helps ensure transparency and consistency when working with business data across your organization, while still allowing for the requirements of individual companies.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            So you have the visibility, control and flexibility you need to be agile, without sacrificing data integrity.

          <p class="text">
            Managing data in a uniform way across your entire organization can improve operational efficiency and business insight. But when you have local subsidiaries or locations with unique requirements, it can be difficult to control and use
            data in a uniform and efficient way.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            DXC Global Data Management works seamlessly with Microsoft Dynamics 365, so that you can take a one-company approach to data governance. The generic interface allows you to replicate data across companies in your ERP installation and to
            determine centrally which information, settings, values and fields can be created, modified and deleted by local companies ‒ so you stay in full control of your critical global business data.

          <p class="text">
            With DXC Global Data Management, you can define a single Global Data Account that acts as a data warehouse for all the master data that you want to replicate to other companies and locations in your organization.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            These companies can be added to Company Groups that are connected to one or more records in the Global Data Account.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Once a company is added to a Company Group, you can synchronize these specific records – including master data, reference data and parameters – with that company using a number of push and pull distribution methods.

          <h1 class="section-title">Structured data access and rights</h1>
          <p class="text">In addition to defining which data each of your companies or local subsidiaries can see, you can also control what they can do with the data locally, based on their company type and business focus.</p>
          <p class="text">For example, you can define that local manufacturing companies get only production- related data and local sales companies receive only sales-related items.</p>
          <p class="text">For each company, you can define which information, settings, values and fields they can see, which they can define or modify, and which they can delete.</p>
          <p class="text">
            This allows local companies to make the necessary modifications they need to meet local requirements, while still ensuring transparency, consistency and governance when working with business data across your organization.
          </p>
          <p class="text">Local organizations can, for example, implement relevant VAT set-ups, or define specific payment- and delivery-terms.</p>
